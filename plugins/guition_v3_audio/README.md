# Guition V3 audio

The ES8311 speaker and ES7210 microphone of the Guition JC8012P4A1 V3: a short click on every tap the screen takes, a
speaker volume, a switch that turns the microphone off, and two tests on the screen's settings page. Only JC8012P4A1 V3
screens are offered it, and only screens that take it carry the audio code.

The audio codecs and I2S-connected speaker and microphone are ESPHome components, so another component in the screen's
Override YAML can use `guition_v3_microphone` and `guition_v3_announcement_resampling_speaker`.

## Set up

1. Have a Guition JC8012P4A1 V3 screen (board `jc8012p4a1v3`) in Tessera.
2. Open **Plugins**, choose **Guition V3 audio** and tick the screen. It builds once with the plugin.
3. On the screen, hold the top bar, then open **Settings**, **Plugins**, **Audio**, and tap **Test the speaker**.

## On the screen

- **Microphone off**: the microphone hears nothing while it is on.
- **Speaker volume**: 0 to 100 %, including the tap sound.
- **Tap sound**: a 60 ms click on every tap the screen takes. It never interrupts a test or recording.
- **Test the speaker**: a tone of 600 ms. Tap the row again to stop it.
- **Test the microphone**: listens for five seconds, then plays what it heard. Tap the row again to stop it. The recording
  stays in PSRAM and is freed after playback.

The three settings are entities of the screen in Home Assistant too ("Microphone mute", "Speaker volume", "Tap sound"),
and stand under Screen settings in the editor.

## Good to know

- Recording uses the microphone's right channel at 16 kHz; playback and speaker tests use a mono 48 kHz output.
- Nothing listens or records unless you start the microphone test.
- The microphone and speaker share one I2S bus, so the screen does not listen while it plays.
- The ES8311 and ES7210 use the board's `touch_bus` I2C bus. Plugin audio is routed through the announcement input
  of the mixer; a media input is also available for a speaker media player configured by the screen.
- The speaker amplifier turns on shortly before playback and off when it ends, to prevent idle hiss.
- The I2S bus uses MCLK on GPIO13, and the microphone input is GPIO48.
- Not yet tested on a physical Guition JC8012P4A1 V3.
