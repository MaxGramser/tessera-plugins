# Testing a plugin

Four ways, from quick to real. A plugin is done when it ran on a real screen.

## 1. The check (seconds)

```sh
python3 tools/check.py plugins/my_idea
```

It runs the Tessera app's own manifest check (`plugin_manifest.py`, downloaded from the Tessera repository into
`tools/.cache/`) and the rules the app cannot see: the files, the translations, the README, the `CHANGELOG.md` (its first
heading is the manifest's version) and the code rules of
[FIRMWARE_API.md](FIRMWARE_API.md). It also checks `plugin.yaml` ([LIMITS.md](LIMITS.md), "plugin.yaml"), and that
what the plugin needs is in the index: the plugins of `requires.plugins`, and a plugin or a board for every feature it
needs (the boards from Tessera's `boards.json`). Working on Tessera itself? Point it at your checkout:
`TESSERA_MANIFEST=../homeassistant_espscreen/screen_manager/app/plugin_manifest.py python3 tools/check.py`, and
`TESSERA_BOARDS=../homeassistant_espscreen/screen_manager/app/boards.json` for its boards.

## 2. A test from GitHub (minutes)

The simplest way onto a real screen: push the plugin to a repository of your own, without a release, and add it with a
link.

1. Push the plugin to GitHub: the whole repository is the plugin, or the plugin is a folder in it.
2. Open Tessera, go to Plugins, **Add with a link**, and paste `https://github.com/<you>/<repo>`, or
   `https://github.com/<you>/<repo>/tree/main/<folder>` for a folder. The app reads the plugin and says whether it fits
   before anything is built.
3. Add it to a screen. A repository without a release is a test of its default branch, with the label **Test**: the
   screen builds the commit the app read. The build's progress and log are in the screen's Plugins tab.
4. Place the tile in Layout and set its options.
5. Push a change. Within the hour the app sees the newer commit and offers it as an update on the screen's Plugins tab;
   one tap builds it. Nothing is built without that tap.

Once the repository has releases, a plain link takes the newest release. To keep testing a branch, choose
**Test a branch** in the same dialog and name it.

## 3. A test folder in Home Assistant (minutes)

Nothing published at all, and every build takes the folder as it is:

1. Copy the plugin's folder into Home Assistant's config, beside the `esphome` folder, under its id:

   ```
   /config/tessera-plugins/my_idea/tessera-plugin.yaml
   /config/tessera-plugins/my_idea/plugin.yaml
   /config/tessera-plugins/my_idea/components/my_idea/...
   ```

   The Samba share, the File editor or `scp` all work.
2. Open Tessera, go to Plugins. The plugin is there with the label **Test**. A folder that is not a valid plugin shows
   what is wrong with it under the list.
3. Add it to a screen. The app writes the screen's plugins file with the folder in it and builds the screen.
4. Place the tile in Layout and set its options.
5. After a change in the folder, open the plugin in the screen's Plugins tab and press **Build again**.

A test folder has no updates: every build takes what the folder holds.

## 4. A build on your own computer

The screen's YAML and its plugins file build anywhere ESPHome runs:

```yaml
# kitchen.yaml, the screen's own YAML (Tessera writes it; the line under packages is added with the first plugin)
packages:
  display:
    url: https://github.com/MaxGramser/homeassistant_espscreen
    ref: dev
    files: [packages/guition.yaml]
  tessera_plugins: !include kitchen.plugins.yaml
```

```yaml
# kitchen.plugins.yaml, written by Tessera; for a plugin you are working on, point it at your folder:
packages:
  plugin_my_idea: !include ../tessera-plugins/my_idea/plugin.yaml
external_components:
  - source: { type: local, path: ../tessera-plugins/my_idea/components }
```

```sh
esphome run kitchen.yaml
```

Building with plugins needs a core with the plugin API: Tessera's `dev` branch until it is released.

## What to look at on the glass

- Every size the tile offers (`sizes` in the manifest), on the smallest screen you have (a CYD if you can) and a large
  one.
- Light and dark (the screen's settings page), so `on_theme` is right.
- Every waiting state: no option filled in, the service down (a wrong host in a copy of the manifest), the first
  seconds after a start.
- A page with the tile, then another page and back: the tile shows the right data at once.
- Memory: the editor's Layout shows how full the screen's memory is; a tile's `memory` that is too low makes that number
  wrong.

## Reporting a problem with a plugin

Open an issue on the plugin's repository, with the board, the screen's firmware version (Screen settings), the plugin's
version and what the screen shows. The screen's log (ESPHome's logs) says when a plugin's tile is made and what it got.
