# The firmware API (plugin API 0.8)

A plugin's code runs on the screen as an ESPHome component. It talks to Tessera's core through one header:

```cpp
#include "esphome/components/smart_display/plugin_api.h"
```

The header lives in the Tessera repository at `components/smart_display/plugin_api.h`; it is the reference, and this
page explains it. Everything is in namespace `tessera`.

**Versions.** A manifest names the plugin API it was written for: `api: "0.8"`, the one the core offers now. A plugin
builds on every core with the same major and at least its minor, and a core with an older API refuses it with one
sentence. From 1.0 on that is a promise: a minor only adds, only a break raises the major. While the API is 0.x a minor
may still change a name or a signature as the API settles, and Tessera's own plugins move with it in the same release.

## The component: `__init__.py`

```python
import esphome.codegen as cg
import esphome.config_validation as cv
from esphome.components import smart_display
from esphome.const import CONF_ID

DEPENDENCIES = ["smart_display"]

my_idea_ns = cg.esphome_ns.namespace("my_idea")
MyIdea = my_idea_ns.class_("MyIdea", cg.Component)

CONFIG_SCHEMA = cv.Schema({cv.GenerateID(): cv.declare_id(MyIdea)}).extend(cv.COMPONENT_SCHEMA)


async def to_code(config):
    var = cg.new_Pvariable(config[CONF_ID])
    await cg.register_component(var, config)
    await smart_display.register_plugin(var, __file__)
```

`smart_display.register_plugin(var, __file__)` finds `tessera-plugin.yaml` above the component folder and:

- checks that the manifest's `api` fits the core's plugin API, and stops the build with a clear sentence when not;
- hands the C++ object the plugin's id and version (`plugin_id()`, `plugin_version()`);
- hands it each tile's `memory` from the manifest, which the screen counts in its layout budget;
- hands it the texts of `translations/<language>.json`, part `screen`, in the language the screen is built in, with
  English for every key that language lacks (`text("key")`).

A plugin with configuration of its own (a pin, a name) adds it to `CONFIG_SCHEMA` as any ESPHome component does, and
`plugin.yaml` passes the values in (`pin: ${PIN}`, from the manifest's `inputs`).

## The plugin: `tessera::Plugin`

```cpp
class MyIdea : public Component, public tessera::Plugin {
 public:
  void setup() override { add_tile("next", [this]() { return new NextTile(this); }); }
  float get_setup_priority() const override { return setup_priority::DATA; }
};
```

| Member | What |
|---|---|
| `add_tile(id, make)` | A tile type, by its id in the manifest. Call it in `setup()`. `make` returns a new tile object; the core deletes it. |
| `add_card(id, make, wide)` | A card, by its id in the manifest's `cards`. `wide`: as wide as the glass instead of a hand's width. |
| `add_tap_action(id, run)` | A tap action for Home Assistant's own tiles, by its id in `tap_actions`. |
| `add_bar_item(id, read)` | An item for the top bar, by its id in `bar_items`. |
| `text(key)` | A text of part `screen` of the plugin's translations, `""` for an unknown key. |
| `plugin_id()`, `plugin_version()` | From the manifest. |
| `memory(tile)` | A tile type's `memory` from the manifest. |

The moments every plugin can hear (override what you need; each has an empty default):

| Moment | When |
|---|---|
| `on_ready()` | The screen's interface is up. |
| `on_interval(now_ms)` | Every 250 ms, the screen's own interval, with `millis()`. Keep it short: the screen draws and takes taps in the same loop. A tile's or a card's `on_tick` is another thing: once a second, with the clock. |
| `on_standby(dark)` | The screen dimmed or went dark (`true`), or woke up (`false`). |
| `before_update()` | A firmware update starts: let go of large buffers. |
| `settings(page)` | Once, when the interface is up: add rows to the screen's settings page (below). Return true when you added some. |
| `on_message(message)` | An answer of the app to `tessera::send()` (below). |
| `on_cards_closed()` | The cards closed: Back, standby, Back to page 1, another card. |
| `on_alert()` | An alert is about to show, a doorbell for example. |
| `on_touch()` | A tap the screen took, after the touch filter: a tile, a key, a button, a row of the settings, Back or the pager. For a click or a buzz. It runs inside the touch event, so start a sound there and never wait for it. A slider's release, a refused tap and the repeat of a held key do not count. |

## A tile: `tessera::Tile`

One tile object per card on the glass. A board with PSRAM keeps the cards of every page, so the object lives as long as
the layout; a board without (the CYD) makes a new object when its page comes back. Never keep anything a tile needs
across objects in a global: what a tile shows comes from its options and its data.

```cpp
class NextTile : public tessera::Tile {
 public:
  explicit NextTile(const tessera::Plugin *plugin) : plugin_(plugin) {}
  void create(const tessera::TileContext &c) override;
  void on_state(JsonObjectConst data) override;
  void on_tick(uint32_t epoch) override;
  void on_theme() override;
  void on_tap() override;
};
```

### The life of a tile

1. **`create(context)`**: once, first. Make every LVGL object inside `context.parent`, read the options.
2. **`on_state(data)`**: right after `create()`, and again whenever the app sent new data, the next time the card is
   drawn. Keep what you need from `data` in members; the JSON is gone after the call.
3. **`on_tick(epoch)`**: right after every `on_state()`, and then once a second while the card is on the glass. Set the
   texts here, from the members and the clock.
4. **`on_theme()`**: the screen went light or dark. Set every colour again.
5. **`on_tap()`**: a short tap on the card, after the touch filter (a finger that moved or was too short never reaches
   it). The tile's `tap` option set to "none" in the editor keeps taps away.
6. **Destructor**: the card shows something else. The core deletes the LVGL objects; free only memory of your own.

A change of the tile's size or options makes a new object: `create()` never has to handle a resize.

### `TileContext`

| Field | What |
|---|---|
| `parent` | The card's drawing area. Everything goes in here. |
| `width`, `height` | Its size in pixels, the card's padding already off. |
| `columns`, `rows` | The grid cells the tile covers (1x1, 2x1, ...). |
| `name` | The name the tile got in the editor, `""` for none. Valid during `create()` only: copy it. |
| `entity` | The Home Assistant entity the tile belongs to (a manifest tile with `domains`), `""` for none. Copy it. |
| `tile` | The tile's index in the layout: pass it to `tessera::open_card` so the card follows the tile. |
| `options` | The tile's options, the manifest's defaults filled in. Read with ArduinoJson: `c.options["walk"] \| 0`. |

### What `on_state` gets

For a tile with `data: <fetch>` in the manifest, the mapped answer of that fetch ([FETCH.md](FETCH.md)):

```json
{ "items": [ { "line": "15", "to": "Station Sloterdijk", "at": 1791386619 } ] }
```

or, for a map without `items`, the fields of one object. Two more keys can be there:

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"stale": true` | The service did not answer the last time; this is the last good answer. Say so if it matters. |
| `"wait": "<why>"` | There is no answer to show: `not_filled` (an option the URL needs is empty), `asking` (the first answer is on its way), `failed` (the service did not answer and there is no older answer), `too_large`, `refused`. |

A tile with `domains` also gets its entity, and is sent again whenever that entity changes in Home Assistant:

```json
{ "state": "off", "name": "Waste", "attributes": { "message": "Paper", "start_time": 1791410400 } }
```

`attributes` holds only the ones the manifest's `attributes` names and the `fields` it takes out of them, a text
cut at 48 bytes. A list comes whole when the tile's data fits its 2.6 KB: two days of 96 prices
do. Lists that do not fit together are shortened, all to the same length, from the end. An
attribute whose name ends in `_at`, `_time` or `date` and holds a moment comes as seconds since 1970, so the tile says it
in the screen's words (`tessera::date_text`, `days_from_today`). `"wait": "wrong_entity"` means the entity chosen in the
editor is of another domain than the manifest names.

A tile without `data` and without `domains` gets `{}`.

## A tile of an entity

In the manifest, `domains: [calendar]` and `attributes: [message, start_time]`. The editor then
offers the entities of those domains in the tile's inspector, also of a domain Tessera itself draws no tile for. To act on
the entity, as a tap on one of Tessera's tiles would:

```cpp
tessera::action("light.toggle", entity_);                                   // returns false when it was not sent
tessera::action("climate.set_temperature", entity_, "temperature", "21");
```

The screen must be allowed to perform actions, and the manifest names each action under
`permissions.home_assistant_actions`.

## A card

A card is a screen of its own over the page, opened by a tile's `on_tap`, a tap action or a settings row. Tessera draws
its frame: the page's ground, a round back key at the top left and the title in the middle; the card draws everything
under it. One card is open at a time, and it closes as Tessera's own cards close: Back, standby, Back to page 1, another
card.

```cpp
class Upcoming : public tessera::Card {
 public:
  void open(const tessera::CardContext &c) override;   // make the parts in c.parent (c.width x c.height)
  void on_state(JsonObjectConst data) override;         // the tile it was opened from changed
  void on_tick(uint32_t epoch) override;                // once a second while open
  void on_theme() override;
  bool on_back() override { return false; }             // true: stay open (you went back a step of your own)
};

add_card("upcoming", [this]() { return new Upcoming(this); });
tessera::open_card(plugin_id(), "upcoming", entity_, tile_);   // from a tile's on_tap
```

`CardContext` has `parent`, `width`, `height`, `entity` (what it was opened for, `""` for none) and `tile` (-1 for
none). `on_state` gets a plugin tile's data, or `{"state", "name"}` of one of Tessera's tiles. The title is the tile's
name unless `open_card` passes one; `tessera::close_card()` closes it as Back does.

## A tap action

A tap action lets a person set one of Tessera's own tiles to do something of the plugin on a tap: a sensor tile that
opens the plugin's card. The manifest's `tap_actions` names the domains it is for; the editor offers it in the tap
choices of those tiles on a screen that runs the plugin. A hold still opens the tile's own card, and a screen without
the plugin does nothing on the tap.

```cpp
add_tap_action("upcoming", [this](const tessera::TapContext &c) {
  tessera::open_card(plugin_id(), "upcoming", c.entity, c.tile);   // c.entity, c.name, c.tile
});
```

## A top bar item

The manifest's `bar_items` lists them; a person places one on a page's top bar in the editor, under "From plugins".
The screen asks the plugin what it shows every few seconds and draws the bar again when that changed:

```cpp
add_bar_item("soon", [this]() {
  tessera::BarItem item;           // shown, icon (a codepoint of Tessera's set), text (a few words), tone
  if (tomorrow_) { item.shown = true; item.icon = 0xF044C; item.text = "Tomorrow: Paper"; }
  return item;
});
```

An item that is not shown takes no room. A screen without the plugin draws nothing for it.

**Its colour (0.8).** `item.tone` colours the icon by what it means, and the core picks the colour in both looks:
`Tone::NORMAL` the bar's own grey, `Tone::ACCENT` the screen's blue (it listens, it is on), `Tone::BUSY` Home
Assistant's amber (it works on something), `Tone::ALERT` its red (a camera that streams, something that went wrong).
The words keep the bar's colour. `ui::set_tone(label, tone, role)` gives a tile's icon the same colours (`role` for
`NORMAL`).

**Icon only.** A person can choose to show an item's icon without its words (Show, Icon only), so give every item an
icon that says it alone.

## Settings rows

Rows on the screen's own settings page (hold the top bar): Settings, then Plugins, then the plugin's page, drawn exactly
as Tessera's rows. Keep the values where Home Assistant sees them too: an ESPHome entity of `plugin.yaml` (a template
switch, number or select with `restore_value`, a text, a button). Name the same entities in the manifest's `settings`
and the editor shows them in the plugin's details on the screen's Plugins tab ([MANIFEST.md](MANIFEST.md), "Settings a
person changes"). These rows on the glass talk to the entities directly, so they work while Home Assistant is away.

```cpp
bool settings(tessera::SettingsPage &page) override {
  page.icon = "\U000F044C";                       // the row's icon in the list of plugins; the title is the name
  page.toggle(text("in_bar"), [this] { return in_bar_->state; },
              [this](bool on) { on ? in_bar_->turn_on() : in_bar_->turn_off(); });
  page.number(text("days_ahead"), 0, 3, 1, "", [this] { return (int) days_->state; },
              [this](int v) { auto call = days_->make_call(); call.set_value(v); call.perform(); });
  page.card(text("open_card"), "\U000F00ED", "upcoming");   // a row that opens a card
  return true;
}
```

Also `choice(label, {words...}, read, write)`, `action(label, icon, run, confirm, text)` and `info(label, text)`. At
most twelve rows. An action with `confirm` asks once, as Restart does. With `text` it says how it is going on its
right, read again every second while the page shows: a test that runs, a countdown. `.active(running)` after it
lights the row in the accent while `running` says so, the way a row that asks is lit; a tap on it is yours to
stop what runs.

```cpp
page.action(text("tone"), "\U000F0387", [this] { tone_ ? stop() : play_tone(); }, nullptr,
            [this]() -> std::string { return tone_ ? text("playing") : ""; })
    .active([this] { return tone_; });
```

## Questions to the app

A plugin may ask Home Assistant something the screen cannot: the events of a calendar, a sensor's history. The app asks
it on the plugin's behalf, only a command the manifest names under `permissions.ha_commands`, and logs every one.

```cpp
JsonDocument request;
request["ask"] = "call_service:calendar.get_events";      // or a websocket command: "history/history_during_period"
request["data"]["entity_id"] = "calendar.waste";
request["data"]["duration"]["days"] = 28;
asked_ = tessera::send(this, request.as<JsonObjectConst>());   // 0 when it could not be sent

void on_message(JsonObjectConst m) override {             // {"re": asked_, "ok": true, "result": {...}}
  if ((m["re"] | 0u) != asked_) return;                    //  or {"re", "ok": false, "error": "not_allowed"}
}
```

`call_service:<domain>.<service>` sends the action with `return_response` and hands back its response; `entity_id`,
`device_id` and `area_id` go as the target, the rest as the action's data. A request is at most 512 bytes; an answer at
most about 3 KB: longer texts are cut to 48 bytes, and lists shortened from the end only when it does not fit. An answer the manifest maps under `answers` comes as its fields: a day of prices as one
list of numbers instead of a list of objects ([MANIFEST.md](MANIFEST.md), "Answers").

## Drawing: `tessera::ui`

The screen's look is the same on every tile, so a plugin draws with the core's sizes, colours and fonts.

| Function | What |
|---|---|
| `ui::mm(n)` | `n` millimetres of glass in this board's pixels. For anything a finger touches (at least 7 mm). |
| `ui::px(n)` | A size of the reference look (a 4-inch Guition at 170 dpi) in this board's pixels. For paddings and gaps. |
| `ui::large()` | The standard look (4 inches and up), or the compact one (the 2.8-inch CYD). |
| `ui::font(Font)` | The screen's font. |
| `ui::line_height(Font)`, `ui::text_width(text, Font)` | To lay out before setting. |
| `ui::label(parent, Font, Role)` | A one-line label, cut with dots when too long. |
| `ui::set_text(label, text)`, `ui::set_font(label, Font)`, `ui::set_color(label, Role)`, `ui::set_tone(label, Tone, Role)` | Change it only when it differs: call them on every tick for free. |
| `ui::block(parent, Role)` | A rounded block with the radius of a key (a badge, a bar). |
| `ui::color(Role)` | A colour by its role. |
| `ui::icon(codepoint)` | An icon of Tessera's set as text, for a label in `Font::ICON` or `ICON_SMALL`. |

Fonts (`tessera::Font`), largest first. Take the largest that fits.

| Font | Used for |
|---|---|
| `VALUE` | The big number of a card. |
| `HEADLINE` | Large words. |
| `TITLE` | A card's name (bold). |
| `BODY_LARGE` | Words on a key. |
| `BODY` | A card's second line. |
| `ICON`, `ICON_SMALL` | Icons of Tessera's set. |

Colours are theme roles (`theme::Role`, from `theme.h`): each has a light and a dark value, so a tile follows the
screen's look. The ones a tile needs most:

| Role | For |
|---|---|
| `theme::INK` | Text, the most important. |
| `theme::INK_SOFT`, `theme::MUTED`, `theme::SUBTLE` | Less important text, in that order. |
| `theme::ACCENT` | The one thing that stands out (a badge, a bar). |
| `theme::ON_ACCENT` | Text on the accent. |
| `theme::CARD`, `theme::RAISED`, `theme::LINE`, `theme::TRACK` | Surfaces and lines inside a card. |

## The rest of the core

| Function | What |
|---|---|
| `tessera::epoch()` | The screen's clock, seconds since 1970; 0 until Home Assistant set it. |
| `tessera::local_time(epoch)` | That moment in the screen's time zone: `year, month, day, hour, minute, second, weekday`. |
| `tessera::clock_text(epoch)` | A time of day as the screen writes it (24 hours or AM/PM, as its settings say). |
| `tessera::format(text, n)` | `{n}` filled in; with `"1 day \| {n} days"` the form that fits `n` in the screen's language. |
| `tessera::fill(text, name, value)` | `{name}` filled in. |
| `tessera::refresh()` | Draw the plugin's cards again in the next pass, after a change outside `on_state` and `on_tick`. |
| `tessera::days_from_today(epoch)` | 0 today, 1 tomorrow, -1 yesterday, on the screen's calendar. `INT32_MIN` while the clock is not set. |
| `tessera::date_text(epoch)` | A day as the top bar writes it: "Fri 9 Oct", "vr 9 okt". |
| `tessera::days_text(days)` | "Tomorrow", "In 3 days" in the screen's language; `""` for today (bring your own word) and the past. |
| `tessera::action(service, entity, key, value)` | A Home Assistant action on an entity (see "A tile of an entity"). |
| `tessera::open_card(plugin_id, card, entity, tile, title)`, `close_card()` | Open or close a card. |
| `tessera::send(plugin, request)` | Ask the app (see "Questions to the app"). |

## Rules

`tools/check.py` refuses code that breaks the first six.

1. **No colour as a number** (`0xFF8800`, `lv_color_hex`): use a role.
2. **No font of your own**: use `tessera::Font`. Every font costs flash, and the 4 MB boards are close to full.
3. **No LVGL click handlers** (`LV_EVENT_CLICKED`, `LV_EVENT_PRESSED`): use `on_tap`, which has the touch filter in
   front of it.
4. **No timers, tasks or waits** (`lv_timer_create`, `xTaskCreate`, `delay`): use `on_tick` and `on_state`. A plugin
   that streams (sound to a speaker) may use its ESPHome component's own `loop()`, as long as nothing in it waits. A
   driver of hardware beside the plugin's own component, one that uses no plugin API and no LVGL, may run a task of
   its own the way ESPHome's drivers do (a camera captures on the other core); rules 1 to 4 are for the code that
   draws and takes taps, rules 5 and 6 for all of it.
5. **No network from the screen** (`http_request`, an HTTP client): data comes through the app's `fetch`.
6. **No walk of the heap** (`heap_caps_get_largest_free_block`, `heap_caps_get_info`): it shifts the picture of an
   RGB panel while it runs.
7. **Make objects in `create()` only.** `on_state` and `on_tick` change what exists; they create and delete nothing.
8. **Keep `memory` honest.** Each LVGL label is about 100 bytes, a block about 80, plus your members.
9. **Icons from Tessera's set only.** Another codepoint shows as nothing.
10. **Text from `translations/`.** No words in the code.

## The examples

- [`template/components/my_plugin/my_plugin.cpp`](../template/components/my_plugin/my_plugin.cpp): a number of days, a
  line of text, the largest font that fits, light and dark. About 90 lines.
- [`plugins/ov_departures/components/ov_departures/ov_departures.cpp`](../plugins/ov_departures/components/ov_departures/ov_departures.cpp):
  data from a fetch, a single-cell layout and a list layout, badges, a countdown every second, waiting states.
- [`plugins/waste_collection/components/waste_collection/waste_collection.cpp`](../plugins/waste_collection/components/waste_collection/waste_collection.cpp):
  most of the API in one plugin: a tile of a calendar entity, a card that asks Home Assistant for the coming events, a
  tap action, a top bar item, two settings rows backed by ESPHome entities of `plugin.yaml`, and an input of kind entity.
- [`plugins/p4_audio/components/p4_audio/p4_audio.cpp`](../plugins/p4_audio/components/p4_audio/p4_audio.cpp): a board's
  own hardware as a plugin (`boards: [wavesharep4]`): ESPHome's speaker and microphone from `plugin.yaml`, brought as the
  features `ts_speaker` and `ts_microphone` for other plugins, a click in `on_touch`, settings actions that say how they
  are going, and sound streamed from PSRAM in `loop()` without a wait.

## Not in the API yet

A plugin's own messages beyond Home Assistant commands, and pictures (a camera of the plugin's own). Each will raise
the minor.
